                <p class="text main-text"><strong>The Secret of High Achievers:</strong> “Ericsson and his
                    colleagues then
                    compared
                    amateur pianists with professional
                    painters. The same pattern emerged. The amateurs never practiced more than about three hours a week
                    throughout their childhood, and by the age of twenty, they had totaled two thousand hours of
                    practice. On the other hand, the professionals steadily increased their practice time every year
                    until, like the violinists, they had reached ten thousand hours by the age of twenty.

                    The striking thing about Ericsson’s study is that he and his colleagues couldn’t find any
                    “naturals,” musicians who floated effortlessly to the top while practicing a fraction of the time
                    their peers did. Nor could they find any “grinds,” people who worked harder than everyone else yet
                    just didn’t have what it takes to break the top ranks. Their research suggested that once a musician
                    has enough ability to get into a top music school, distinguishing one performer from another is how
                    hard they work. That’s it. And what’s more, the people at the very top don’t work just harder or
                    even much harder than everyone else. They work much, much harder.

                    The idea that excellence at performing a complex task requires a critical minimum level of practice
                    surfaces again and again in studies of experts. Researchers have settled on what they believe is the
                    magic number for true expertise: 10000Hours.

                    The emerging picture from such studies is that ten thousand hours of practice is required to achieve
                    the level of mastery associated with being a world-class expert. It seems that it takes the brain
                    this long to assimilate all it needs to know to attain a true form of mastery.” <br><br>

                    <strong>Mathew Principle:</strong> It is those who are successful, in other words, are most likely
                    to
                    be
                    given the
                    kinds of exceptional opportunities that lead to further success.

                    <strong>Practice:</strong> Practice isn't the thing you do once you are good. It's the only
                    thing you do that makes you
                    good.
                    You become good at something when you do it consistently. If you put in the time and the work
                    daily
                    on something, it becomes a habit. Imagine if you counted the hours spent working on the things
                    you
                    do daily. The secret of the future is hidden in our daily routine.</p>
